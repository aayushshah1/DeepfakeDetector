Hi Copilot. I trying to implement a research paper for Deepfake Detection using:
- Xception - Extracts deep features from images
- EfficientNet-B7 - Extracts additional feature representations
- Feature Selection - Ranking-based selection to reduce redundant features
- Meta-Learner (MLP) - Uses selected features to classify Real vs Fake videos

## Downloading the processed dataset
I have already processed the CelebDF V2 Dataset available on kaggle. Using Face detection CNN, I have extracted the faces from the videos. The entire dataset of images is saved on Amazon AWS S3 bucket. 
It contains: `train`, `test`, `validate` folders each having `real` and `fake` subfolders
```sh
  wget https://deep-fake-dataset.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/PreprocessedDatasetV1.zip

  unzip PreprocessedDatasetV1.zip
```

## Summary of the Authors' work (in their words)
In summary, the key points of our work can be listed as follows:
- We have proposed a stacking based ensemble method, where features generated by dual CNN models are stacked followed by the selection of optimal features and elimination of inconsistent features.
- Feature selection is performed by averaging the feature importance scores obtained from two machine learning models, sorting them in descending order, and then choosing the top-k% of the entire stacked features.
- Our method has been tested and validated using two widely used and difficult benchmark datasets, namely FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF. The results demonstrate that our system surpasses the performance of numerous state-of-the-art methods.
- We have conducted a thorough evaluation of our model's performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, and our results are highly promising. Additionally, our robustness assessment shows satisfactory performance when subjected to a brightness test.

### Steps:
1) Create a Cropped Face Dataset from the videos
2) Feed them into Xception and EffcientNet-B7 CNN Models
3) Create a feature vector of both the models
4) Use Feature selection to select top k-% features (Random Forest and XG Boost Classifers are used to extract the most important features, then sort them)
5) Use Meta Learner (MLP) to give results

## Work Already completed
1) I have already completed the Preprocessing steps including creating a dataset with only cropped faces from videos. 

## Work to be done
1) Using Xception and EfficientNet-B7 as Models for to create feature vectors
2) Train these models
3) Create a Feature Vector from the output of these model
4) Use XGBoost and Random forest to select most important features
5) Feed it to a meta-learner to get an output

## Environment for training and testing
- I am using Google Colab's free tier for training my model with access to a T4 GPU
- As you see, this comes with several restrictions
- 12.7 GiB of CPU RAM
- 14 GiB of Video Memory
- Session time of 2 hours
- I need to ensure that these resources are being utilized to the fullest, without crashing

## General Instructions
- I want the code for this to be efficient and error free
- It should be able to handle error and edge cases
- Should be in Python Notebook Format
- Properly separated sections
- No depreciated code to be used
- Correct semantics and comments
